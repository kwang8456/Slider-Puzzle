<!-- This project was decent. Something that went well was the CSS because creating the table 
    and making the layout look presentable was pretty easy. However, something that didn't go 
    as intended was trying to code the functions that would make the puzzle move in the correct
    order and place. It was mostly practicing already known skills because I have used the 
    tables, buttons, and innerHTML for my project. One thing that sticked to me the most is the 
    document.getElementById ("").innerHTML because I have been using it repeatedly throughout my
    whole entire project. -->
